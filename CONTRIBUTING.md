PiicoDev Unified Library `PiicoDev_Unified.py` attempts to unify different development platforms so the same user code can be used regardless of platform choice.

As such, it has to bear certain constraints.

Before contributing to this repo, have a read of an [illustrative example](https://forum.core-electronics.com.au/t/piicodev-detecting-which-sensors-are-attaced/18170/29) before proceeding.

PiicoDev_Unified has to respect certain memory restricitons imposed by Micro:bit V2, as such - each contribution should tread very lightly on overall file size and respect the current class structure.
